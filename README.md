# The Sack: A Digital Archive of Women's Stories

## About The Sack  
**The Sack** is a **digital humanities project** dedicated to preserving the stories of objects carried by women across generations. Inspired by *Tiya Miles*'s book *All That She Carried*, this archive seeks to document personal artifacts and their journeys, offering a space for memory, history, and storytelling.

The project is named after **Ashley’s Sack**, a simple cloth bag given by an enslaved mother, **Rose**, to her daughter **Ashley** before they were forcibly separated. It contained a tattered dress, three handfuls of pecans, and a lock of hair—items chosen with care and love in the face of an uncertain future. Decades later, Ashley’s descendant, **Ruth Middleton**, embroidered its story onto the fabric, transforming it into a powerful testament to love, resilience, and historical survival.

**The Sack** continues this tradition by allowing individuals to share the personal objects that carry their own histories—whether it be a letter, a piece of jewelry, or a worn-out suitcase. Each object tells a story of migration, inheritance, memory, or resistance.
